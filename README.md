# Hunting-Party
A decentralized work, social, and communication platform with consensus and leadership selection functions

## Value Proposal
Inspired by the [rafting algorithm](https://matthew.krupczak.org/2019/11/11/failure-tolerance-with-the-rafting-algorithm-kubernetes) used by [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

Hunting party (working title) would be:
* An online app for communicating with a group
* [Very broad](http://www.danah.org/papers/Supernova2004.html) in usability / use cases a la [Slack](slack.com) or [Trello](trello.com) ([+](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2014/07/24/trello-inc/))
* Core feature will be allowing decentralized groups to select a leader and sub-leaders in a fair way
* designed to solve one of biggest problems in decentralized groups: leadership selection and consensus decision making
